# Binary-Search-Tree
This program is coded in C. In this, I have implemented many Binary Search tree methods.
Some of the operations implemented are :

Create a new tree
Insert a new node
Traverse tree
Find Min/Max
Search a node
Compare trees
Clone Binary tree
Delete a node
Delete leaf node
Delete tree
Heapify`
